# SpringBootAppEngineFlex
This repo contains a sample App Engine Flex SpringBoot application and a sample Apigee Edge proxy which leverages a Shared Flow that enables authenticating to Google Cloud Platform's Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) with a GCP Service Account.  

The instructions for deploying the SpringBoot application can be found in the `helloworld-springboot` directory.
